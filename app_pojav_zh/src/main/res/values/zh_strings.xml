    <string name="zh_help_control_button_title">What is Control Layout?</string>
    <string name="zh_help_control_button_message">Control Layout plays a vital role in the game by displaying buttons on the screen, which allows users to interact with the game. This simulates the process of using a keyboard to control the game in Minecraft: Java Edition. In the Control Layout Management interface, you can manage all the current control layouts, load and modify or create a new set of control layouts, import, or share control layouts.</string>
    <string name="zh_help_instance_title">What is Game Instance?</string>
    <string name="zh_help_instance_message">Game Instance is like a list that includes various information about the game. It tells the launcher which game version, control layout, and rendering engine you want to use to start the game. Therefore, the launcher can start the corresponding game according to your needs. Game instances are independent of each other, but you can choose the same things in multiple instances, such as the same set of control layouts. When starting a game from the main menu, you need to choose a game instance, and you need to make sure that all the things selected in your game instance are normal and available, or you may encounter unexpected problems.</string>
    <string name="zh_help_files_title">Pojav ZH Main Directory</string>
    <string name="zh_help_files_message">The main directory refers to the main directory where Pojav ZH stores game data. This interface is like a simple file manager, allowing you to manage all files in the main directory freely. However, please be cautious about the files here. Improper operations may cause the launcher to malfunction or the game to fail to start!</string>
    <string name="zh_help_mod_title">What is Mod?</string>
    <string name="zh_help_mod_message">It can be understood as a third-party plugin for the game, which can modify the game or add more interesting content to the game. Minecraft: Java Edition usually cannot load Mods, but the player community has developed third-party loaders for Minecraft, which can load Mods, and these third-party loaders are independent game versions. You do not need to choose between the original version and the third-party loader. The Mod management interface can manage all Mods in the "mods" folder in the custom path of the current game instance, or you can import Mods yourself, which requires you to download them from the resource website.</string>
    <string name="zh_help_other_login_title">What is external login?</string>
    <string name="zh_help_other_login_message">External login options are usually provided for players to use third-party login services, rather than Minecraft\'s official login method. It allows for more flexible account management and access to unique features and services provided by the third-party service. \nExternal login is often used in conjunction with skin sites, where you can register an account to manage your skins and use them in Minecraft through external login. \nTo use external login, you need to first add an authentication server. This means adding a skin site of your choice; please refer to the site\'s instructions for specific steps. \nAfter adding the site, you can then log in with the account you registered on that site!</string>
    <string name="zh_help_modpack_title">What is a Mod Pack?</string>
    <string name="zh_help_modpack_message">A Mod Pack is a client file package containing multiple mods that are integrated together, allowing players to easily experience new gameplay and content. By installing a Mod Pack, players can acquire a large amount of new game content in one go, without having to individually search for and install each mod, saving time and energy.\nPlease note that the majority of Mod Pack authors are primarily catering to PC players and they usually do not take into consideration Pojav players who may attempt to use their Mod Packs. Considering that Mod Packs often contain a large number of mods, it is inevitable that issues may arise, such as incompatibilities or performance problems.\nTherefore, it is essential to carefully choose and consider your own device performance and needs, and to be cautious when selecting a Mod Pack to avoid unnecessary difficulties!</string>
    <string name="zh_help_mouse_title">How to use Virtual Mouse Manager?</string>
    <string name="zh_help_mouse_message">In the virtual mouse manager interface, you can view and add virtual mice. Clicking on a virtual mouse allows you to select, rename, or delete it. \nVirtual mice are essentially textures. You can draw your own or find suitable virtual mice, then import them into the launcher and select them as the virtual mouse in the game. \nHere, you can only select image files. Any other files are not supported!</string>
